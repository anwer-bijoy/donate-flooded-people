                <p>Flood shelters are generally made of concrete because they are easy to construct, strong and cost
                    efficient. They are elevated on strong pillars with a deep foundation designed to withstand high
                    winds, water levels, and potentially scour, in high flow environments.

                <p>Without quality education, children face considerable barriers to employment and earning potential
                    later in life. They are more likely to suffer adverse health outcomes and less likely to participate
                    in decisions that affect them – threatening their ability to shape a better future for themselves
                    and their societies.
